# chat.rb

This is a self-contained script which, when run, allows you to add a message to the chat history. You would, then, have to pass the script around. Convenient _and_ scalable!

Big thanks to @fabrik42 for their [fantastic talk](https://github.com/fabrik42/single-file-ruby-programs) which taught me that this was even possible
